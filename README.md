Verilog file naming convention: combinatorial_<INTEGER>.v

Netlist JSON file naming convention (generated by verilog_to_netlist.py) : netlist_<INTEGER>.json

Fault list JSON file naming convention (generated by fault_list_gen.py or fault_list_gen_v2.py) : fault_list_comb_<INTEGER>.json

fault_list_gen.py --> considers PI and fanout only

fault_list_gen_v2.py --> considers PI,PO and fanout only

logic_evaluator.py --> computation done by compute() function. Tester should invoke this function. Needs two parameters : a list of operand words (strings of any length) and a string mentioning the operation (and,or,not,buf,notif1,notif0,bufif1,bufif0,nand,nor,xor,xnor). For tristate gates, exactly two input words : first word is input, second word is control.

logic_eval_checker.py --> invokes logic_evaluator.py, checks for all single input, 2 input and 3 input gates for all possible combinations of 3 bit word length vectors
The exhaustive test results are written into a .txt file which is > 100MB, hence I will attach google drive link. If needed, that part can be commented out. FINAL SUMMARY is printed in terminal.
